# Eye Movement
## Description
In this project, I have created a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement. This is a playful project that people could have a lot of fun interacting with.

## How to Run
Just put the URL of this project on your browser! to see the animation move the mouse around the screen.

## Roadmap of future improvements
I am planning to add a functionality that allows us to change the background design in future improvements. These designs could simulate the shape of different animal faces for example.

## License information
This project has an MIT license.
